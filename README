Here are the slides for FAD Beijing 2011 on Oct 15.
You should be able to compile the source files by:
	xelatex texlive-talk
with TeX Live 2011.

If there are any problems, report it to me, either by
opening new issues on github, or just emailing me:
alick <alick9188 NOSPAM AT gmail DOT com>

Of course the problems here mean those like `I missed to
include some pictures or dependent files.', not that
problems during installing TeX Live. That's another story.
However, feel free to inform me of fixes and enhancements
of the slides.
